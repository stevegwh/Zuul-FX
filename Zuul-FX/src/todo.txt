Move remove item etc to CSVEditor and have them edit the list, not the room hashmap
Make the appendText function print the csv in rows, not everything with a new line
Have a "commit changes" button that then initalises all the rooms in the game with the new data.
You'll need a way of updating the CSV text on the screen after an update. (I think just running appendText afterwards would do, tbh)
